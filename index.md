# Short Bio

<div style="text-align:justify">
Elias D. Nino-Ruiz is an accomplished professional with a strong academic background and extensive industry experience. He obtained his Diploma in System Engineering (2007), M.Sc. in System Engineering (2009), and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering (2010) from the prestigious Universidad del Norte (UniNorte) in Barranquilla, Colombia. He further pursued his passion for knowledge and earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Applications (2015) from the renowned Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, USA.


Throughout his career, Elias has made significant contributions to the field of computational science and applied mathematics. He has worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, USA (2013), and <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, USA (2014), gaining invaluable hands-on experience in cutting-edge research and development. From 2011 to 2015, Elias served as a research assistant in the esteemed <a href="https://csl.cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Science Laboratory</a> at Virginia Tech, where he actively contributed to various research projects and published numerous papers in reputable journals and conferences. During his time at Virginia Tech, he also served as an instructor of Numerical Methods (2015), mentoring and guiding students in their academic pursuits. In 2016, Elias joined UniNorte's Department of Systems Engineering as an Associate Professor and assumed the role of Director of the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory. In this capacity, he has been instrumental in leading research initiatives and mentoring students, fostering a collaborative environment that encourages innovation and academic excellence.

Elias's expertise extends beyond academia, and he is recognized as a leading figure in the industry. His remarkable achievements and dedication to his field led him to be invited to join the Early Career Advisory Board of the Control Engineering Practice Journal, Elsevier, in 2022. This position showcases his standing as a trusted expert and his commitment to advancing the field of control engineering. With a profound interest in computational science, applied mathematics, and applied statistics, Elias has consistently demonstrated his ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world challenges. His industry experience, combined with his academic achievements, enables him to bridge the gap between theory and practice, delivering innovative solutions that drive progress and success.
