## Industry Experience

### Estimating Prices in Freight Markets

The project focused on developing machine learning models to estimate RPM (rate per mile) and rates in the freight transportation industry. Two versions of the model were provided, each built using a different approach. Model 1 utilized a dbt pipeline for data extraction, transformation, and loading, while Model 2 employed Python for these tasks. The models incorporated various variables to accurately estimate prices, including mode, distance, angles, and more.
Main tasks executed in the project: 
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading using a dbt pipeline (Model 1).
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading using Python (Model 2).
- Feature engineering to incorporate variables such as mode, distance, angles, etc.
- Training machine learning models using a Random Forest algorithm.
- Evaluating model accuracy using TRAC/Contract datasets.Creating training and validation sets with representative lane characteristics.
- Testing the models for different scenarios and resolutions.

#### Major contributions:
- Leveraged dbt (data build tool) to develop a robust data pipeline for Model 1, including data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- Utilized Python for data extraction, transformation, and loading in Model 2, providing an alternative approach for the project.
- Incorporated various technologies and techniques to accurately estimate prices, including feature engineering and the utilization of Random Forest algorithm.
- Implemented testing methodologies using TRAC/Contract datasets to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the developed models.
- Developed flexible and customizable solutions, allowing for different scenarios and resolutions in estimating RPM and rates in the freight transportation industry.
- Leveraging dbt and Python for data extraction, transformation, and loading provides the client with flexibility in choosing the preferred approach based on their existing infrastructure and technology stack.

#### Technologies: 
dbt (data build tool) for data extraction, transformation, and loading (Model 1). Python for data extraction, transformation, and loading (Model 2). Random Forest algorithm for machine learning modeling (BigQuery Machine Learning - ML and Python scikit-learn ).
