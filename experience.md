# Experience

I have developed a strong background and expertise in data engineering, data analysis, and data assimilation. Throughout my career, I have acquired proficiency in various tools and technologies, including dbt (data build tool), Python (including the Pandas library), Jinja templating language, Google BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

In the field of data engineering, I have demonstrated my ability to create robust and scalable data pipelines using dbt, Python, and Jinja templating. I take pride in ensuring consistent and clean data for analysis, leveraging my skills in transforming and querying data effectively.

My expertise in data analysis shines through my proficiency in utilizing Python for tasks such as data manipulation, aggregation, calculations, and data filtering. Whether it's conducting daily or weekly analyses, I am able to derive meaningful insights by examining specific metrics and uncovering valuable patterns in datasets.

An essential aspect of my work is integrating visualization and reporting tools to present analysis results effectively. By utilizing tools like Looker Studio, I have been able to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide stakeholders with a user-friendly and informative experience. This highlights my strong communication skills and my ability to effectively convey complex data analysis to a diverse audience.

My experience showcases my competence in data engineering, data analysis, and visualization. I am skilled at handling complex datasets, extracting valuable insights, and presenting analysis results in a clear and compelling manner.
