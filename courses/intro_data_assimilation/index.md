## Overview

This graduate course in Data Assimilation explores the process of adjusting imperfect numerical forecasts using real noisy observations. The course covers ensemble-based data assimilation, including conceptual, theoretical, and practical aspects. Students will use Python as the primary computational language to support their learning and discussions.

## Student Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Design data assimilation problems effectively.
2. Mitigate the impact of sampling errors in ensemble-based data assimilation.
3. Employ spatial error correlations to reduce uncertainty in numerical forecasts.
4. Quantify uncertainty in analysis solutions.

## Course Justification

Numerical models play a crucial role in various scientific contexts as they help encapsulate our knowledge of natural phenomena's physics and dynamics. These models typically involve Partial Differential Equations, which allow us to better understand how our world works. However, they only partially represent the real physics and dynamics of nonlinear phenomena, leading to limited validity in forecasts.

While observations can be used to build machine learning models and produce forecasts, they only temporarily capture the actual dynamics, and extrapolation assumptions are poorly maintained in practice. Moreover, measurements are only available in certain regions with sensors or satellite radiances.

Combining both sources of information—numerical forecasts and observations—leads to more accurate predictions and valid forecasts for more extended periods, even in areas where observations are unavailable. This course aims to provide students with the skills to effectively combine these sources and improve forecasts in various scientific contexts.

### Background - Vectors, Matrices, and Operations

Understanding the concepts of vectors, matrices, and their operations is crucial in data assimilation because they form the foundation of mathematical models and computational techniques used in the field. The representation of vectors as column vectors, various vector and matrix operations, norms, and decompositions are all vital components in the process of combining numerical forecasts with real-world observations to improve predictions.

Vectors and their operations, such as inner and outer products, allow the manipulation and representation of data in multidimensional spaces. This is essential in data assimilation, as it often deals with large amounts of data from different sources, and these operations help combine, compare, and analyze the information.

Matrices play a significant role in data assimilation as they represent linear transformations, systems of equations, and relationships between variables. Understanding the properties of square matrices, such as positive definiteness, orthogonality, and triangular matrices, is necessary for analyzing and solving various problems in data assimilation.

Matrix norms and properties are essential in determining the quality and stability of numerical solutions. The condition number, for instance, helps assess the sensitivity of a problem to perturbations in the input data, which is crucial for understanding the reliability of the assimilation results.

Decompositions, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and spectral decomposition, provide valuable insights into the structure of matrices and facilitate solving complex problems more efficiently. These techniques are used in data assimilation to analyze and process large datasets, reduce dimensions, and improve computational efficiency.

A thorough understanding of vectors, matrices, and their associated concepts is critical for students studying data assimilation. These foundational concepts enable them to develop and apply advanced techniques in data assimilation to improve numerical forecasts and reduce uncertainties in various scientific contexts.

### Numerical models

Numerical models play a critical role in data assimilation. They are used to simulate the physical processes that govern the behavior of the atmosphere, ocean, or other systems of interest. These models are designed to solve the equations that describe these processes using numerical methods.

In data assimilation, numerical models are used to generate forecasts of the system state. These forecasts are then compared to observations, and the resulting differences are used to update the model state through the assimilation process. The accuracy of the forecasts depends on the accuracy of the numerical models used to generate them.

The use of numerical models in data assimilation presents several challenges. First, numerical models are often computationally expensive, which limits their practical use in real-time applications. Second, numerical models are subject to errors and biases, which can affect the accuracy of the forecasts and the quality of the assimilation results. To address these challenges, researchers have developed a variety of techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical models, such as model error correction, adaptive model refinement, and stochastic parameterization.
