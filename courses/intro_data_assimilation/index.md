## Overview

This graduate course in Data Assimilation explores the process of adjusting imperfect numerical forecasts using real noisy observations. The course covers ensemble-based data assimilation, including conceptual, theoretical, and practical aspects. Students will use Python as the primary computational language to support their learning and discussions.

## Student Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Design data assimilation problems effectively.
2. Mitigate the impact of sampling errors in ensemble-based data assimilation.
3. Employ spatial error correlations to reduce uncertainty in numerical forecasts.
4. Quantify uncertainty in analysis solutions.

## Course Justification

Numerical models play a crucial role in various scientific contexts as they help encapsulate our knowledge of natural phenomena's physics and dynamics. These models typically involve Partial Differential Equations, which allow us to better understand how our world works. However, they only partially represent the real physics and dynamics of nonlinear phenomena, leading to limited validity in forecasts.

While observations can be used to build machine learning models and produce forecasts, they only temporarily capture the actual dynamics, and extrapolation assumptions are poorly maintained in practice. Moreover, measurements are only available in certain regions with sensors or satellite radiances.

Combining both sources of information—numerical forecasts and observations—leads to more accurate predictions and valid forecasts for more extended periods, even in areas where observations are unavailable. This course aims to provide students with the skills to effectively combine these sources and improve forecasts in various scientific contexts.
